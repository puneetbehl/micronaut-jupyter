### Add Build Dependency (Gradle)
Ensure the following repositories are added to your gradle build:
```Groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}
```
Add the following dependency to your gradle build:
```Groovy
dependencies {
    implementation "ai.stainless:micronaut-jupyter:0.2.4"
}
```

### Configure your Jupyter Kernels Directory
Ensure that your app can write to a directory where Jupyter will search for
kernels.

#### Option 1 - Easiest (**Possible security vulnerability!**)
The default directory is `/usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels`, so the following
is sufficient:
```bash
chmod 777 /usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels
```

#### Option 2 - May be More Secure
Create a separate directory, say at `/opt/jupyter-alt/kernels`, that your app
can write to. Then, configure Jupyter to search this directory using
https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/projects/jupyter-directories.html#envvar-JUPYTER_PATH[JUPYTER_PATH].
Lastly, add the following config to your application.yml:
```yml
jupyter:
  kernel:
    location: /opt/jupyter-alt/kernels
```
